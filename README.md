# JSMiner
I created this Chrome extension as an additional help when conducting application testing. It works by collecting any .js endpoint from the page source of the current page you are currently on, and find additional URLs and endpoints, which can be goldmine for recon.

## Installation
- Download the repo and store it in a folder.
- Navigate to chrome://extensions
- Enable developer mode
- Click "Load unpacked"
- Load the folder where you stored the source code

## Usage
- Pin the extension and click "mine"
